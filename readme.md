## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized ecosystem where knowledge sharing is incentivized through tokenized rewards. By motivating content creators, we aim to foster a collaborative and educational community that leverages blockchain technology to reward and recognize contributions.

## Key Features
- **Token Rewards**: Content creators receive `TUT` tokens for their contributions.
- **Decentralized Governance**: A transparent smart contract governs token distribution.
- **Custom Incentives**: Admins can allocate rewards based on quality, views, or other metrics.
- **Ownership Control**: Only the owner can reward contributors, ensuring proper oversight.
- **ERC-20 Standard**: Implements the widely adopted ERC-20 standard for interoperability.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with video platforms to automate token rewards based on views or ratings.
- Decentralized voting to determine reward allocation criteria.
- Expanding token utility within the ecosystem.
